# Implementation notes for Indeed scraper
"""
INDEED SCRAPER IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE
===================================

1. Anti-Bot Challenges:
   - CAPTCHA after ~10-20 requests
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Requires realistic user behavior
   - May need residential proxies

2. Technical Requirements:
   - Wait for dynamic content loading
   - Handle infinite scroll or pagination
   - Extract from complex nested HTML
   - Deal with sponsored vs organic results

3. URL Structure:
   - Base: https://www.indeed.com/jobs
   - Query: ?q=LLM+Engineer&l=Houston%2C+TX
   - Filters: &radius=25&sort=date&fromage=7
   - Salary: &salary=80000

4. Key Selectors (as of 2024):
   - Job container: '[data-testid="job-result"]'
   - Job title: 'h2[data-testid="job-title"] a span'
   - Company: '[data-testid="company-name"]'
   - Location: '[data-testid="job-location"]'
   - Snippet: '[data-testid="job-snippet"]'
   - Salary: '[data-testid="salary-snippet"]'

5. Best Practices:
   - Start with simple queries
   - Use random delays (2-5 seconds)
   - Rotate user agents
   - Monitor for blocking
   - Implement exponential backoff
   - Consider using Indeed's official API (if available)

6. Implementation Priority:
   - HIGH - Indeed has the most job volume
   - Expected 3-5x more LLM jobs than ZipRecruiter
   - Better enterprise and tech company coverage
