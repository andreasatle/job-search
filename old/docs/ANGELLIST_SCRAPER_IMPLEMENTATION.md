## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Startup-Focused Filter Configuration
```python
# Standard mode - balanced risk/reward
min_salary = $85,000      # Lower base + equity compensation
min_quality_score = 0.6   # Startup job descriptions vary
allowed_job_types = [FULL_TIME, CONTRACT]

# Strict mode - premium startup roles
min_salary = $110,000     # Higher base for senior roles
min_quality_score = 0.7   # Quality startup opportunities
allowed_job_types = [FULL_TIME]
```

### Multi-Site Configuration
```python
"angellist": {
    "enabled": True,
    "max_pages": 2,  # Conservative for startup platform
    "priority": 5,   # Specialized startup focus
    "expected_results": "startup_focused",
    "specialties": ["startups", "equity", "early_stage", "founding_engineer"]
}
```

### Conservative Rate Limiting
```python
min_delay = 2.0          # Respectful delays
max_delay = 6.0          # Moderate pacing
max_requests = 15        # Reasonable session limits
slow_mo = 600           # Careful automation
